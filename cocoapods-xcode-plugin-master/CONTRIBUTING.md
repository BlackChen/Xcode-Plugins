Thank you for your interest in making a contribution to the cocoapods Xcode plugin. There are a few general guidelines for making a submission:

## Style

1. The plugin source uses
[LLVM](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) style formatting. When in doubt, check existing source for hints. Using a tool like `clang-format` also recommended.

2. Keep the header formatting consistent with the LICENSE file

## Pull Requests

Minimize the number of changes in a single request. They'll get merged faster that way. :)
